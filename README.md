## Abstract:

Welcome to 19Check!

For avid World of Warcraft Classic players, gearing up a 19-level twink character is both an art and a science. However, with the impending Cataclysm expansion, significant changes are on the horizon, and many cherished gear items are set to become unavailable or "grandfathered."

The Gear Check App is your essential tool to navigate through the impending cataclysmic changes to gear availability. Specifically curated for the 19-level PvP bracket, this app provides a comprehensive overview of gear items that are at risk of being phased out or altered in Cataclysm.

Explore the app to understand which gear items are likely to be affected, categorized by class, faction, and item rarity. As Cataclysm approaches, use the Gear Check App to make informed decisions about your character's gear setup and ensure that your twink is ready to face the challenges ahead.

Gear up wisely, and may your twink characters stand strong even in the face of Cataclysmic changes!

## Context:
This is my mod3 Showcase project for Turing School of Software and Design, but I hope it is of use to many of my friends in the 19 bracket!

## Learning Goals:

- Use the technology youâ€™ve been working with over the course of the module to demonstrate mastery of the following:
- React
- Router
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- End to end testing with Cypress
- Create personas and user stories to describe your target audience.
- Work within constraints to deliver a product for your niche audience, which helps solve a problem unique to them.
